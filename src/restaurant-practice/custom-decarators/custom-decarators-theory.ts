// Custom decorators in NestJS allow you to extend the built-in decorators provided by the framework or create your own decorators to add custom metadata and behavior to classes, methods, properties, or parameters. Custom decorators can help you achieve a more modular, organized, and readable codebase by encapsulating specific functionality and annotations.

// why use them  in code

// You can create reusable decorators that can be applied to multiple parts of your application, reducing code duplication.

// Decorators can attach metadata to classes, methods, or parameters, which can be useful for various purposes like validation, authorization, logging, and more.
