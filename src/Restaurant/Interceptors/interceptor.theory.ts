// In NestJS, interceptors are a powerful feature that allow you to intercept and manipulate the flow of data between the client and the route handler. Interceptors can be used to perform tasks such as modifying the request or response objects, transforming data, adding headers, logging, and more. They provide a way to modify the behavior of requests and responses globally or for specific routes.

// Global and Local Scope: Interceptors can be applied globally to the entire application or locally to specific controllers or routes.

// Order of Execution: Interceptors are executed in the order they are defined. You can control the order of execution using the @UseInterceptors() decorator.

// Request Flow: Interceptors can intercept the incoming request before it reaches the route handler. They can modify the request, add headers, or perform validation.

// Response Flow: Interceptors can also intercept the outgoing response before it is sent to the client. They can modify the response data, headers, or status code.

// Transformation: Interceptors can transform the data of the request or response, converting it to a different format (e.g., converting data to JSON, XML, etc.).

// Error Handling: Interceptors can catch errors and exceptions that occur during the request processing and customize the error response.
